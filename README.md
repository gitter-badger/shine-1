An attempt at a cross platform package manager.

## Install Shine
I have created an easy installer script to install Shine and set it up on your computer. Run one of the following.
macOS/Linux:
`curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flash76/shine/master/install_shine.sh`

## Community Information
For this project to fully come to fruition, the community must be involved.
I need Shine Repo Curators to add software to the repositories. More information will come soon.

## Repositories
It's going to be some time until I get the Repositories set up. I will update this section
once I do this.
